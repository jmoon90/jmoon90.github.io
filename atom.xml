    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During my first week at Launch Acadmey I built a simple ruby script so that I don&rsquo;t have to leave my keyboard to ask a question through google. I call it NoMouse.</p>

<p>The idea came when Johnny, one of my mentors at LaunchAcademy, taught me that everything we do in our GUI can be done through the terminal. This was a very interesting and cool concept as a beginner. I wanted to test this theory out. I wanted to see if I can open up my browser from the terminal and open a specific page.</p>

<p>Here is how I tackled the theory. I needed to first figure out how to open a browser or website through my terminal.</p>

<blockquote><p>open &ldquo;<a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>This was possible. Now I need to know if I can run a script and open a browser. In my terminal I ran ruby browser.rb and it would run the following script.</p>

<blockquote><p>system(&ldquo;open&rdquo;, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>&rdquo;)</p></blockquote>

<p>This opened up possibilities for me. I was becoming greedy! Not only could I open a browser I wanted to see if I can feed a question to the script for it to search.</p>

<p>I needed to figure out what goes after &ldquo;.com/&rdquo; for google to search. I went to google and typed in a search. How to play basketball.</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.google.com/#q=how+to+play+basketball">https://www.google.com/#q=how+to+play+basketball</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The important part of the link is everything following the &ldquo;.com/&rdquo; Google uses &ldquo;#q=&rdquo; and a &ldquo;+&rdquo; symbol for every space. Simply add the &ldquo;#q=&rdquo; to the system and then create a variable to substitute spaces for &ldquo;+&rdquo; symbols.</p>

<blockquote><p>text = gets.chomp
text.gsub!(&ldquo; &rdquo;,&ldquo;+&rdquo;)
system(&ldquo;open&rdquo;, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.google.com/#q=text">http://www.google.com/#q=text</a>&rdquo;)</p></blockquote>

<p>Ideally, this would turn all the white spaces to a &lsquo;+&ldquo; and we start with the &rsquo;/#q=.&lsquo; It is exact to the google search. This did not work. The # kept changing into &rsquo;%23&#8217; when opens the google browser. When I type &#8220;How do I play basketball?&rdquo; =></p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.google.com/%23q=%7BURI.escape">http://www.google.com/%23q=%7BURI.escape</a>(@question)%7D
It also leads to an error page. The browser is encoding # => %23. I had such a hard time figuring out how to either solve or get around this problme. I figured that there was no way of me to control google from changing # into %23. I needed another solution.</p></blockquote>

<p>Breaking what I have done is found another way google searches. The escape method defined in the ruby doc, &ldquo;Escapes the string, replacing all unsafe characters with code.&rdquo; Basically when i input a question with all the &lsquo;unsafe&rsquo; symbols, and spaces with safe code Here is my final code.</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=#">http://www.google.com/search?q=#</a>{URI.escape(@question)}</p></blockquote>

<h4>Lastly, if you have any recommendations for me to improve this script or a vision of where you think this could go. Please feel free to share with me at my twitter handle. &ndash; @johnmoon6</h4>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/jmoon90/nomouse">Visit the repo</a></h4>

<p>The idea is that I run the nomouse.rb script and it will prompt a message, &lsquo;What is your question?&rsquo; then the user will input a question they have. This triggers your default browser to open and google search the question.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Using Vim is one of the most amazingly frustrating, confusing, rewarding, and geeking out feeling ever. If you asked me how to copy something in Vim you were out of luck, because I couldn&rsquo;t even navigate folders and files in vim.</p>

<p>This journey of teaching myself Vim with the help of Eric from LA has been a very rewarding. I still have to use Sublime rarely when I want to copy big chunkcs of code on a chat or my gist page, but give me another week and I am confident I&rsquo;ll figure it out.</p>

<p>Having used Sublime for quite some time now, here are some a list of things that each editor does better.</p>

<h3>Vim</h3>

<ol>
<li>Move around super fast. I installed relative numbers so that I can go to the exact line I want to change.</li>
<li>No mouse. It&rsquo;s self explainatory.</li>
<li>You feel awesome slowly mastering and the in&rsquo;s and out&rsquo;s of the editor.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t know when the learning curve ceiling ends. I learn something new to improve my day to day coding every days.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Sublime</h3>

<ol>
<li>Super easy to use. Basically no learning curve.</li>
<li>Command-p is a little bit better than Vim&rsquo;s. E.G. Searching for file apple_to_go.rb. In sublime you can type apple to go and it will search for you. In vim you have to pretty much type it exactly how it is. If you put a space between words it won&rsquo;t suggest any results.</li>
<li>Copy and paste is terribly easy.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Quick tips to learning Vim</h3>

<ol>
<li>Read vimtutor in your terminal</li>
<li>Watch how people move around files. Through videos, mentor, or friend.</li>
<li>Learn how to move around. I find this the most important part in Vim. You want to jump lines, words, paragraphs, and screens comfortably and efficiently, less key strokes the better.</li>
<li>Keep going at it. It gets easier and becomes fun getting things right!</li>
</ol>


<p>Overall I think it is important to improve and increase the tools in your development toolbox and Vim is definitely a big improvement for me. I see myself working towards understand vim in a deeper level in the upcoming weeks. I am excited to see what more I can do with this new found tool.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;November 11 is the first day of class. This is a high intensity program to teach and push the group to become junior software developers, roughly 1 year epxerience in the Ruby on Rails (RoR) world. </p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I chose to attend such a program is because it aligns with my goal of building a successful business from scratch. I want to experience the full spectrum of starting and running a business&hellip; even to it&rsquo;s fall. I&rsquo;ll have to take everything in, for my next business. I was hesitant to drop 10 grand and leave my full time job to this fairytale of a dream and join Launch Academy, where I couldn&rsquo;t find much information about the process, hire rates, and simply information about the quality of the program compared to Dev Bootcamp and App Academy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fear quickly dissipated when I heard <a href="http://podcasts.thoughtbot.com/giantrobots/54">Ben Orenstein talk</a> about these popular bootcamps. He said he noticed trends of these popular bootcamps emerging and though it was great. He mentioned that it really wasn&rsquo;t the quality of these bootcamps that makes you a great developer, but your own desire to learn and be great. I&rsquo;m paraphrasing, but that was the gist.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m exicted to start on Monday and become a great programmer. I want to be the best of the class and I&rsquo;ll work hard to make a mark. Cheer for me :D</p>
