	<div class="entry-content"><p><b>I&rsquo;m</b> currently learning ruby on rails at Launch Academy, a programming bootcamp. During the past 3 weeks I have been working on my breakable toy <a href="http://www.pairstudying.com/">pair studying</a>.</p>

<br/>


<p><b>The</b> idea came, prior to joining Launch Academy, when I was studying alone following Michael Hartl&rsquo;s tutorial. The rails tutorial was amazing, it gave me so many great insights and a good view of what Rails is and what it can do. However, I struggled hard!!! My code would break and I couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it :( I either had to start over or ignore the problem and keep going on. This happened frequently and I was not happy. The problem was that if I had someone to look over my code, they probably would have spotted my error or at least help me fix it. I found that one of the more common reasons my program would break was due to spelling errors.</p>

<br/>


<p><b>With</b> <a href="http://www.pairstudying.com/">pair studying</a> I hope to knit together an online community to help each other learn. I admit there are kinks that I have yet to be fixed. It is far from finished, but I wanted to share it with the community so that I may get feedback and learn from you and hopefully it may benefit your studying. There are many other features and UI designs I want to add.</p>

<br/>


<p><b>Also,</b> I will be graduating Launch Academy next week. Woot! I learned so much from my helpful mentors and I want to give back. I&rsquo;m looking for 4 individuals who want to go through Rails Tutorial with me. We will be covering 1 to 2 chapter each week, haven&rsquo;t fully decided the pace yet. The course will cost $25 that will be donated to <a href="http://www.railsbridge.org/">Railsbridge</a>, check them out if you haven&rsquo;t heard about them! I&rsquo;m not charging to make money, nor do I think I&rsquo;m that good to be charging money. You&rsquo;re paying as a way of making a commitment. I&rsquo;m hoping to get serious students who really want to learn and will follow through by putting the time and effort needed to become a developer.</p>

<br/>


<p><b>The</b> process will entail students going through each chapter on their own. When they get stuck on a problem, they can share the problem on the site or possibly reach me through skype, haven&rsquo;t fully decided on either. Students will be learning by helping and teaching each other solve problems. I will be there to answer questions, but really hope that the interaction amongst students will be enough to solve problems. I plan to be heavily involved in the beginning of the phase and become less and less present as a gradually releasing them into the wild (launch academy has proven to be successful). I will be spending around 2 hours each week helping with questions and just talking about the process. If you&rsquo;re interested feel free to tweet me or visit my site and contact me through the form, and if you&rsquo;re on reddit just pm me. Also I&rsquo;m requiring my students to post at least 1 to TodayILearned on my site. Throughout my experience at Launch Academy we have <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/standupmeeting.html">daily standups</a>. In short, it is to share what you have done, learned, or stuck on. I want everyone to share what they have learned so that others can benefit from your learning.</p>

<br/>


<p><b>I&rsquo;m</b> only hitting the surface with programming and I&rsquo;m very excited to have made this! Makes me proud. Thanks for reading. Feel free to share or leave me comments and I&rsquo;ll answer them promply.</p>

<p>Work Hard and Dream Big :)
