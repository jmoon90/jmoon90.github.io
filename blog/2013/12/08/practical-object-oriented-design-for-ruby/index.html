	<div class="entry-content"><p>In the past week at Launch Academy we dived into object oriented programming. Here is a definition by <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_object_oriented.htm">tutorialspoint</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ruby is pure object-oriented language and everything appears to Ruby as
an object. Every value in Ruby is an object, even the most primitive
things: strings, numbers and even true and false. Even a class itself
is an object that is an instance of the Class class.</p></blockquote>

<p>My definition is classes are there to help organize and structure
the program so that it may be easily consumed by others. Todays post is
about POODR that adds on top of my definition. It is a way to organize
and structure program so that it may be easily consumed AND changed as
new features are added.</p>

<p>I love that! As programmers, not only should we be thinking to making a
working app, but also an app that has low replacement cost in the future. The idea is
to write code that is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design">SOLID</a> (Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, and Dependancy Inversion). I&rsquo;m currently focusing on the single responsibility section of the SOLID. I find it difficult as a programming beginner to write classes that are loosely coupled as I want them to be. I started with classes that were family and knew everything about each other. However, with some easy to implement tricks and tips from the book I am learning to write more loosely coupled programs.</p>

<p>For instance, I wrote a program about a company with many employees, who
wanted to know if their employee owed taxes or was due a refund. My
first instinct was to create a company class and an employee class. I
was having difficulty of instantiating a single employee. The problem
was that I was iterating and saving the employees into a single hash,
then passing the hash to the employee class. This caused 2 problems.
First all my employees were a single instance. Second, because they are
a single instance when I passed in the instance to the Employee class,
the employee class was not reading in 1 employee at a time, but the
whole slob.</p>

<blockquote><p>class Company</p>

<blockquote><p>def load_data(file)</p>

<blockquote><p>employees = []
CSV.foreach(file, :headers => true) do |row|</p>

<blockquote><p>employee = row.to_hash</p>

<p>employees &lt;&lt; employee</p></blockquote>

<p>end</p>

<p>employees</p></blockquote>

<p>end</p></blockquote>

<p>end</p>

<p>Employee.new(employees)</p></blockquote>

<p>For an experienced developer the solution was right in front of them. The fix was quite simple. I just needed to change where I was instantiating the object. The previous code changed to the following.</p>

<blockquote><p>class Company</p>

<blockquote><p>self.load_data(file)</p>

<blockquote><p>employees = []
CSV.foreach(file, :headers => true) do |row|</p>

<p>employee = Employee.new(row.to_hash)</p>

<p>employees &lt;&lt; employee</p></blockquote>

<p>end</p>

<p>employees</p></blockquote>

<p>end</p></blockquote>

<p>This instantiates each employee separately as I pull data from the CSV file. Now
when I pass my employee to the Employee class, it will be of 1 instance
of an employee. The benefit is that I won&rsquo;t have to do an iterator in my
employee class but instead I can iterate inside my company class.</p>

<p>Another trick I found very useful was passing in hashes as arguments
instead of a multiple variables. The benefits are that you don&rsquo;t have to
worry about in what order you pass in the arguments. If you don&rsquo;t pass
in a value for a specific instance, you can simply give it a default
value.</p>

<blockquote><p>class Employee</p>

<blockquote><p>def initialize(arguments)</p>

<blockquote><p>@employee = arguments[&lsquo;employee&rsquo;] || &lsquo;missing name&rsquo;
@tax_owed = arguments[&lsquo;tax_owed&rsquo;] || &lsquo;0&rsquo;
@tax_paid = arguments[&lsquo;tax_paid&rsquo;] || &lsquo;0&rsquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>end</p></blockquote>

<p>end</p></blockquote>

<p>Hope you learned something from that. If you have any cool tricks feel
free to share in the comments.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>
